# WeatherApp
A simple weather app that calls data from weather.gov using the Core Location data in swift.
# Purpose
This app shows the core mechanics of making API calls using swift with SwiftUI and formatting it into a decent UX. This also shows many different ways to format or convert data types, now not that this program is perfect but it shows the processes needed to make a dynamic app using information from a server.
